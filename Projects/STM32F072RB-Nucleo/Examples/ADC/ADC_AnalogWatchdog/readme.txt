@par Example Description 

How to use the ADC peripheral to perform conversions with an analog watchdog 
and out-of-window interrupts enabled.

One compilation switch is available to select ADC configuration continuous mode
and external trigger (located in main.h):
 - "ADC_TRIGGER_FROM_TIMER" defined: ADC is operating in not continuous mode
   and conversions are trigger by external trigger: timer.
 - "ADC_TRIGGER_FROM_TIMER" not defined: ADC is operating in continuous mode
   and first conversion is trigger by software trigger.

One compilation switch is available to generate a waveform voltage
for test (located in main.h):
 - "WAVEFORM_VOLTAGE_GENERATION_FOR_TEST" defined: For this example purpose, generates a
   waveform voltage on a spare DAC channel DAC_CHANNEL_1 (pin PA.04).
   If ADC channel and DAC channel are selected on the same GPIO (default configuration
   in this example):
   connection is done internally in GPIO pad, user has nothing to connect.
   If ADC channel and DAC channel are selected on two different GPIO:
   user has just to connect a wire between DAC channel output and ADC input to run this example.
 - "WAVEFORM_VOLTAGE_GENERATION_FOR_TEST" not defined: no voltage is generated, user has
   to connect a voltage source to the selected ADC channel input to run this example.


Other peripherals related to ADC are used:
Mandatory:
 - GPIO peripheral is used in analog mode to drive signal from device pin to
   ADC input.
Optionally:
 - Timer peripheral is used to trigger ADC conversions.
 - DMA peripheral is used to transfer ADC converted data.

ADC settings:
 - Regular group:
   Conversions are triggered by external event (timer at 1kHz).
 - Continuous mode is disabled (and sequencer disabled: only 1 channel selected) to yield only 1 conversion at each conversion trigger.
 - Analog watchdog 1 is enabled, minimum and maximum thresholds are respectively set 
   to 1/8 and 5/8 of full range scale (between 0.41V and 2.06V with full range of 3.3V).

ADC conversion results:
 - ADC regular conversions results are transferred automatically by DMA, into variable
   array "aADCxConvertedValues".
 - DMA and ADC are configured to operate continuously, in circular mode.
   When DMA transfer half-buffer and full buffer lengths are reached, callbacks 
   HAL_ADC_ConvHalfCpltCallback() and HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback() are called.

Board settings:
 - ADC is configured to convert ADC_CHANNEL_4 (pin PA.04).
 - Channel configured on regular group:
   The voltage input on ADC channel is provided from DAC channel.
   ADC and DAC channel have been chosen to have the same pad shared at device level: pin PA.04.
   ==> PA.04 is connected to pin 32 on CN7
   ==> Therefore, there is no external connection needed to run this example.
 - Voltage is increasing at each click on push button, from 0 to maximum range in 4 steps.
   Clicks on push button follow circular cycles: At clicks counter maximum value reached, counter is set back to 0.

STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board LED is be used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED2 is turned-on/off in function of ADC conversion
   result.
    - Turned-off if voltage into of AWD window
    - Turned-on if voltage is out of AWD window
 - Error: In case of error, LED2 is toggling at a frequency of 1Hz.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board. 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@par Example Description

How to use the DAC peripheral to generate a constant voltage signal. This
example is based on the STM32F0xx DAC LL API. The peripheral 
initialization uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes
(performance and size).

Example configuration:
One DAC channel (DAC1 channel1) is configured to connect DAC channel output on GPIO pin
to get the samples from SW (no DMA transfer) and to get conversion trigger from SW.

Example execution:
From the main program execution, LED is toggling quickly while waiting for
user button press.
Then, the DAC is configured and activated: constant signal is generated on DAC output
indefinitely.
DAC channel output value is provided by SW, a new value is loaded
at each press on push button: start from 0, increased by a quarter of Vdda and
finishing at Vdda voltage.
Finally, LED is turned-on.

Connection needed:
None. 
Oscilloscope for monitoring DAC channel output (cf pin below).
Other peripheral used:
  1 GPIO for push button
  1 GPIO for DAC channel output PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

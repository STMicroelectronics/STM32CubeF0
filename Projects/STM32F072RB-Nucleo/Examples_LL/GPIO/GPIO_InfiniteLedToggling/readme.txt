@par Example Description

How to configure and use GPIOs to toggle the on-board user LEDs 
every 250 ms. This example is based on the STM32F0xx LL API. The peripheral 
is initialized with LL unitary service functions to optimize 
for performance and size.

PA.05 IO (configured in output pushpull mode) toggles in a forever loop.
On STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board this IO is connected to LED2.

In this example, HCLK is configured at 48 MHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072xB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

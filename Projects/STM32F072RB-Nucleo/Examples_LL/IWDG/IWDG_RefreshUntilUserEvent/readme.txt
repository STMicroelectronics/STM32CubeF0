@par Example Description

How to configure the IWDG peripheral to ensure periodical counter update and 
generate an MCU IWDG reset when a user button is pressed. The peripheral 
is initialized with LL unitary service functions to optimize 
for performance and size.

Example Configuration:
Configure the IWDG (prescaler, counter) and enable it.
Infinite refresh of the IWDG down-counter done in the main loop.
Led is blinking fast & continuously

Example Execution:
When User Button is pressed, the down-counter automatic refresh mechanism is 
disable and thus, reset will occur. After a reset, when re-entering in the main, 
RCC IWDG Reset Flag will be checked and if we are back from a IWDG reset the led
will be switch ON.

Waiting a new user button pressed to re-activate the IWDG

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072xB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

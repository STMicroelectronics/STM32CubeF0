@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral to perform a single ADC conversion on a channel, 
at each software start. This example uses the interrupt programming model 
(for polling or DMA programming models, please refer to other examples).
This example is based on the STM32F0xx ADC LL API.
The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions 
for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
ADC interruption enabled: EOC (end of conversion of ADC group regular).

Example execution:
At each press on push button, the ADC performs 1 conversion of the selected channel.
When conversion is completed, ADC interruption occurs.
IRQ handler callback function reads conversion data from ADC data register
and stores it into a variable, LED is turned on.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values

Connection needed:
None.
Note: Optionally, a voltage can be supplied to the analog input pin (cf pin below),
      between 0V and Vdda=3.3V, to perform a ADC conversion on a determined
      voltage level.
      Otherwise, this pin can be let floating (in this case ADC conversion data
      will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for push button
  1 GPIO for LED
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)

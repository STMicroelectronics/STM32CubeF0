@par Example Description

Configuration of a timer to generate a positive pulse in 
Output Compare mode with a length of tPULSE and after a delay of tDELAY. This example 
is based on the STM32F0xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

The pulse is generated on OC1.

This example uses 2 timer instances:

  - TIM1 generates a positive pulse of 50 us after a delay of 50 us. User push-button
    is used to start TIM1 counter.

                                                |_ uwMeasuredDelay

  TIM1_CH1 delay and pulse length are measured every time a pulse is generated. 
  Both can be observed through the debugger by monitoring the variables uwMeasuredDelay and
  uwMeasuredPulseLength respectively.

  - TIM2 generates a positive pulse of 3 s after a delay of 2 s. TIM2 counter start
    is controlled through the slave mode controller. TI2FP2 signals is selected as
    trigger input meaning that TIM2 counter starts when a rising edge is detected on
    TI2FP2. The TIM2 output channel is mapped on the pin PA.05 (connected to LED2 on board
    STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC). Thus LED2 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output level (active v.s. inactive).

Both TIM1 and TIM2 are configured to generate a single pulse (timer counter 
stops automatically at the next update event (UEV).

Connecting TIM1 OC1 to TIM2 TI2 allows to trigger TIM2 counter by pressing
the User push-button.

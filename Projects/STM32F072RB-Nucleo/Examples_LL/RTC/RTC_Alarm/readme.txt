@par Example Description

Configuration of the RTC LL API to configure and generate an alarm using the RTC peripheral. The peripheral initialization 
uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
HSI48 as clock source.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the Configure_RTC() function 
(configure of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware CLOCK, 
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

@note LSI oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source by default.
      The user can use also LSE as RTC clock source. The user uncomment the adequate 
      line on the main.c file.
      @code
        #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSI  
        /* #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSE */
      @endcode
      LSI oscillator clock is delivered by a 40 kHz RC.
      LSE (when available on board) is delivered by a 32.768 kHz crystal.

Configure_RTC_Alarm function is then called to initialize the 
time, date and alarm.

In this example, the Time is set to 11:59:55 PM and the Alarm must be generated after 
30 seconds on 12:00:25 AM.

The current time and date are updated and displayed on the debugger in aShowTime 
and aShowDate variables (watch or live watch).

- LED2 is turned ON when the RTC Alarm is generated correctly.
- LED2 is toggling : This indicates that the system generates an error.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072xB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

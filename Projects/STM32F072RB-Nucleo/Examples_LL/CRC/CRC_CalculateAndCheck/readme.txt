@par Example Description

How to configure the CRC calculation unit to compute a CRC code for a given data
buffer, based on a fixed generator polynomial (default value 0x4C11DB7). The
peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions for
optimization purposes (performance and size).

The CRC peripheral is configured to work with default polynomial value (32-bit long).
Normal representation of this polynomial value is :
 X^32 + X^26 + X^23 + X^22 + X^16 + X^12 + X^11 + X^10 +X^8 + X^7 + X^5 + X^4 + X^2 + X + 1.
Generated CRC value is then 32 bits long

Example execution:
After startup from reset and system configuration, CRC configuration is performed (use of default Polynomial and initialisation values).
CRC code of a given data buffer is computed. 
Data buffer length has been chosen as not an exact nb of u32 (32-bit words), in order to illustrate 
use of offered API for feeding the calculator (u32, u16 or u8 inputs).
The calculated CRC code is stored in uwCRCValue variable.
Once calculated, CRC value (uwCRCValue) is compared to the CRC expected value (uwExpectedCRCValue),
and if both are equal, LED is turned On. 
In case of errors, LED is blinking (1sec period).

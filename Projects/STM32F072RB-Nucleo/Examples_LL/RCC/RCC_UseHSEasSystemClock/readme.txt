@par Example Description 

Use of the RCC LL API to start the HSE and use it as system clock.

At start-up, HSI clock is used as system clock (default clock after reset) and then Systick is 
configured at 1 ms using HSI_VALUE define.

Then, HSE is started and we wait for ready state. System clock is set to HSE thanks to IT 
triggered by HSE ready.
- LED2 is turned ON to indicate that HSE is ready.
- LED2 is toggled with a timing of 1 second in case of error to switch SYSCLK to HSE or if HSE CSS
failure is detected (through NMI IT).

 @note In HSE bypass mode, input clock will come from the MCO from
       ST_LINK MCU. This frequency cannot be changed, and it is fixed
       at 8 MHz. To use MCO from ST_LINK you need to check the Board
       User Manual to know how to connect the MCO pin to the STM32 device.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072xB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

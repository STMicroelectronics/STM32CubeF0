@par Example Description 

Configuration of the TIM peripheral to generate a timebase of 
one second with the corresponding interrupt request.

    In this example TIM2 input clock (TIM2CLK)  is set to APB1 clock (PCLK1),
    since APB1 prescaler is equal to 1.
      TIM2CLK = PCLK1
      PCLK1 = HCLK
      => TIM2CLK = HCLK = SystemCoreClock
    To get TIM2 counter clock at 10 KHz, the Prescaler is computed as following:
    Prescaler = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1
    Prescaler = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 48 MHz for STM32F0xx Devices.

The TIM2 ARR register value is equal to 10000 - 1, 
Update rate = TIM2 counter clock / (Period + 1) = 1 Hz,
So the TIM2 generates an interrupt each 1 s

When the counter value reaches the auto-reload register value, the TIM update 
interrupt is generated and, in the handler routine, PC.09 is toggled with the 
following frequency: 

- PC.09 : 0.5Hz

In case of error, LED3 is turned ON.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick Timebase is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072RB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F072B-Discovery RevC
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.      

  - STM32F072B-Discovery RevC Set-up
    - Use LED5 connected to PC.09 pin and connect them on an oscilloscope 
      to show the Timebase signal.  


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@par Application Description

Use of the USB device application based on the Human Interface (HID).

This is a typical example on how to use the USB peripheral in Device mode with HID class V1.11
following the "Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID) Version 1.11
Jun 27, 2001".

This example supports the remote wakeup feature (the ability to bring the USB suspended bus back
to the active condition), and the Tamper button is used as the remote wakeup source.

By default, in Windows OS, the USB mouse Power Management feature is turned off. This setting
is different from classic PS/2 computer functionality. To enable the Wake up from  standby
option, user has to manually turn on the Power Management feature for the USB mouse.

To enable the wake from standby option for the USB mouse, the following steps have to be followed:
 - Start "Device Manager",
 - Select "Mice and other pointing devices",
 - Select the "HID-compliant mouse" device (make sure that PID &VID are equal to 0x5710 & 0x0483 respectively)
 - Right click and select "Properties",
 - Select "Power Management" tab,
 - Finally click to select "Allow this device to wake the computer" check box.

The function GetPointerData() is responsible to move the mouse cursor.
The Tamper button mounted on the board is used to move the Mouse cursor.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is
provided with the SystemClock_Config()function to configure the clock (SYSCLK).
In this application the system clock is set to 48MHz.

The 48 MHz clock for the USB can be derived from one of the two following sources:
  – PLL clock(clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLL as clock source.
  – RC48 Clock (HSI48): The HSI48 clock is generated from an internal 48 MHz RC oscillator, coupled with
    the clock recovery system (CRS).
    The CRS allows automatic trimming of the internal HSI48, synchronized with USB SOF signal at 1KHz rate,
    to guarantee its optimal accuracy over the whole device operational range.
User can select USB clock from HSI48 or PLL through macro defined in main.h
(USE_USB_CLKSOURCE_CRSHSI48 and USE_USB_CLKSOURCE_PLL).

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay
      (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that
       if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt
       must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the peripheral interrupt.
       Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. To change the SysTick interrupt
       priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL configuration.

@note To reduce the example footprint, the toolchain dynamic allocation is replaced by a static allocation
      by returning the address of a pre-defined static buffer with the HID class structure size.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072VB devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32072B-EVAL RevB board and can be easily tailored
     to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32072B-EVAL MB1070 Rev B Set-up
    - Connect the STM32072B-EVAL board to the PC through 'USB A-Male
      to A-Male' cable to the CN4 connector

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

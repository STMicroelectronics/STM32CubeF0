@par Application Description

This example provides a description on how to use STM32Cube firmware with FatFs 
middleware component as a generic FAT file system module, in order to develop an
application exploiting FatFs offered features with microSD drive configuration. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock
(SYSCLK) to run at 48 MHz.
 
The application is based on writing and reading back a text file from a drive,
and it's performed using FatFs APIs to access the FAT volume as described
in the following steps: 

 - Link the uSD disk I/O driver;
 - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the uSD drive;
 - Create a FAT file system (format) on the uSD drive;
 - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
 - Write data to the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Open text file object with read access;
 - Read back data from the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Check on read data from text file;
 - Unlink the uSD disk I/O driver.

It is worth noting that the application manages any error occurred during the 
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs. Otherwise, user can check if the
written text file is available on the uSD card.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values 
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes 
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements. 

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the example status:
  - LED1 is ON when the example runs successfully.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072VB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32072B-EVAL RevB board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.        

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

  |_________________________|                     |_________________________|

Board 1 enters STOP mode and is awoken by Board 2 which sends
the proper data to wake up the board 1 MCU.
When the proper wake-up event is recognized, the WUF interrupt is triggered which wakes
up board 1.
To confirm its wake up, board 1 sends a confirmation message to board 2 which
checks it is the expected message.
This cycle is repeated 4 times to verify 4 different events
1°) wake-up by RXNE flag rising
2°) wake-up by Start Bit detection
3°) wake-up by 7-bit long address match
4°) wake-up by 4-bit long address match




WARNING: as both boards do not behave the same way, "BOARD_IN_STOP_MODE" 
compilation switch is defined in UART/UART_WakeUpFromStop/Src/main.c and must be
enabled at compilation time before loading the executable in board 1 (that which
is set in STOP mode).
The stimuli-transmitting board (board 2) needs to be loaded with an executable
software obtained with BOARD_IN_STOP_MODE disabled. 


At the very beginning, board 1 LED1 is ON then is turned off.
This means that board 1 has entered STOP mode.
Parallely, board 2 LED1 is quickly blinking (100 ms period). The user has 
just to wait for board 1 LED1 to be turned off then to press board 2 Tamper push-button 
to send the first wake-up stimulus to board 1. 
This starts the test sequence and no more action is required from the user
(a single USER push-button press is needed to start the full 4 wake-up events
test sequence). 

Board 1 LED1 behavior as described below allows to follow the 
test progress:

Simultaneously, board 2 LED1 behavior shown below allows to follow the 
test progress on the other side:

                    Detection)         match)           match)
     

    
- If the test fails or if there is an initialization or transfer error, LED1
transmits a sequence of three dots, three dashes, three dots.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 48 MHz.  


The UART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 bits (8 data bits, no parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - Parity none
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)


@note USARTx/UARTx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
file depending hardware configuration used.

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact that the 
    Cortex-M0 core is no longer clocked during low power mode and so debugging 
    features are not available.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

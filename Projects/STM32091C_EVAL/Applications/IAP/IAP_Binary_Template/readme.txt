@par Application Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that build the application to be
loaded into Flash memory using In-Application Programming (IAP) through USART.

To build such application, some special configuration has to be performed:
1. Set the application load address at 0x08004000, using your toolchain linker file
2. To be able to serve the application interrupts, you need to relocate the vector 
   table (which contains the interrupt handlers). However, unlike CortexM3 and CortexM4, 
   the CortexM0 processor do not support vector table relocation (it is fixed at 
   address 0x00000000).
   A solution will be to relocate by software the vector table to the internal SRAM:  
    - Copy the vector table from the Flash (mapped at the base of the application load
      address 0x08004000) to the base address of the SRAM at 0x20000000.
    - Remap SRAM at address 0x00000000, using __HAL_SYSCFG_REMAPMEMORY_SRAM() macro
    - Then once an interrupt occurs, the CortexM0 processor will fetch the interrupt 
      handler start address from the relocated vector table in SRAM, then it will 
      jump to execute the interrupt handler located in the Flash.
   This operation should be done at the initialization phase of the application.    

The SysTick example provided within the STM32F0xx HAL Cube examples is used as illustration.
This example configures the SysTick to generate a time base equal to 1 ms.
The system clock is set to the maximum system frequency, the SysTick is clocked by 
the AHB clock (HCLK). A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick 
end-of-count event.
Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32091C-EVAL evaluation board
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?  

In order to load the SysTick example with the IAP, you must do the following:

 - EWARM:
    - Open the Project.eww workspace
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
    - A binary file "STM32091C_EVAL_SysTick.bin" will be generated under "STM32091C_EVAL/Exe" folder.  
    - Finally load this image with IAP application

 - MDK-ARM:
    - Open the Project.uvproj project
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
    - Go to "/IAP_Binary_Template/Utilities" directory and run "axftobin.bat"
      (Fromelf Exe path might have to be updated in "axftobin.bat" file, according to your Keil setup).
    - A binary file "STM32091C_EVAL_SysTick.bin" will be generated under "/IAP_Binary_Template/MDK-ARM/STM32091C_EVAL" folder. 
    - Finally load this image with IAP application

 - SW4STM32
    - Open the SW4STM32 toolchain.
    - Browse to the SW4STM32 workspace directory, select the project (.project file in \IAP_Binary_Template\SW4STM32\STM32091C_EVAL directory).
    - Rebuild all project files.
    - A binary file "STM32091C_EVAL.bin" will be generated under "STM32091C_EVAL\Debug" folder. 
    - Finally load this image with IAP application

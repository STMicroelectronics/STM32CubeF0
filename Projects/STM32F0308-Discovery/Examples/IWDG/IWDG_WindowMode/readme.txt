@par Example Description 

How to periodically update the IWDG reload counter and simulate a software fault that generates 
an MCU IWDG reset after a preset laps of time.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 48 MHz.

The IWDG time-out is set to 762 ms (the time-out may varies due to LSI frequency 
dispersion).

The Window option is enabled with a window register value set to 400 ms.
To prevent a reset, the down-counter must be reloaded when its value is:
 -lower than the window register value (400ms)
 -greater than 0x0
The IWDG counter is therefore refreshed each 450 ms in the main program infinite loop to 
prevent a IWDG reset (762 - 450 = 312 within the interval).
LED3 is also toggled each 450 ms indicating that the program is running. 
LED4 will turn on if any error occurs.

An EXTI Line is connected to a GPIO pin, configured to generate an interrupt
when the User push-button (PA.00) is pressed.

Once the EXTI Line event occurs by pressing the User push-button (PA.00), 
the refresh period is set to 200 ms.
That will make refresh being outside window value. As a result, when the IWDG counter is reloaded, 
the IWDG reset occurs.

If the IWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED3 turns on for 4 seconds.

If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the IWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
in the main program infinite loop, and there is no IWDG reset.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F0308-Discovery RevA board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Download and Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
